✅ In Your Project

You wrote:

spring.security.user.name=Rohith
spring.security.user.password=Rohith


So now:

If someone opens http://localhost:8080

Spring Security will show a login popup

User must enter:

Username: Rohith

Password: Rohith

If correct → Access granted
If wrong → Access denied
